# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

`![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)`

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

or

```bash
uv add typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.
The parenthesis at the end indicates what module the bullet point is related to. Please be honest in your answers, we
will check the repositories and the code to verify your answers.

>
> Example:

> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

We used Ruff for both linting and formatting our code. Ruff is a fast Python linter that enforces PEP8 standards and automatically formats code to maintain consistency. For type checking, we implemented mypy to validate type hints throughout our codebase. Documentation was handled through Google-style docstrings for all functions and classes. These tools are integrated into our CI/CD pipeline through GitHub Actions and pre-commit hooks, ensuring code quality checks run automatically before code is merged.

These concepts are critical in larger projects for several reasons. Code formatting ensures consistency across the codebase, making it easier for team members to read and understand each other's code. Linting catches potential bugs and code smells early in development. Type hints with mypy provide compile-time error detection, reducing runtime errors and making the code self-documenting. Good documentation through docstrings helps new team members quickly understand function purposes and expected inputs/outputs. Together, these practices reduce technical debt, improve collaboration, and make the codebase more maintainable as it scales.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

We implemented 32 tests across multiple test suites. Our unit tests cover data loading and preprocessing functionality (test_data.py), model architecture and forward pass behavior (test_model.py), and API endpoints including root, health, and prediction endpoints (test_api.py). We also have integration tests that verify end-to-end API functionality with a running server, performance tests that measure model inference speed against defined thresholds, and load tests using Locust to validate API performance under concurrent requests. These tests ensure our data pipeline, model, and API work correctly both individually and together.

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

Our current test coverage is 23% across the codebase. Major gaps are in API request/response paths, dataset preprocessing branches, drift monitoring code, and training/evaluation scripts, which currently sit at low or 0% coverage. Even with 100% coverage we would not assume the code is bug-free: coverage only shows lines executed, not that outputs or edge cases are correct. If a function or class has 100% test coverage it just means that the edge cases that are handled, have tests. It does not mean that all edge cases are handled. The easiest way to achieve 100% test coverage is to handle any edge cases at all (or not even write any code at all). High-value tests must assert behavior (outputs, error handling, performance thresholds) and include integration paths.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we made extensive use of branches and pull requests in our workflow. Each team member created a new branch when implementing a new feature or fixing a bug. Once coding was complete, the member would pull the latest changes from main and merge them into their branch to ensure compatibility. After pushing their changes, they would create a pull request to merge into main. GitHub Actions automatically ran our test suite on each pull request, and merging was only allowed if all tests passed successfully.

For smaller changes, team members could skip pulling main first and create the pull request directly. GitHub would indicate whether the merge could happen automatically. If merge conflicts arose, the member would resolve them before proceeding. This workflow ensured code quality through automated testing, prevented breaking changes from reaching main, and provided visibility into what each team member was working on through the pull request interface.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

Yes. We used DVC to keep all team members on the exact same dataset. Any data curation steps (e.g., removing bad samples) were versioned so cloud training always pulled the latest validated data. DVC stored large files in remote storage while Git tracked only small metadata, so we could `dvc pull`/`dvc push` without bloating the repo.

In CI and unit tests we ran `dvc pull`, allowing tests to use the real dataset automatically instead of relying on mock data. This avoided passing data files around manually, reduced “works on my machine” drift, and kept a clear lineage of which data version was used for each run. Overall, DVC gave us reproducible data access locally, in CI, and when training in the cloud.

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing*
> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

We split CI by job so it is clear and fast, and we run it on every push/PR to main. Linting lives in [./github/workflows/linting.yaml](.github/workflows/linting.yaml): `uv sync` (with cache) installs deps, then ruff lint/format checks and mypy run. Unit tests are in [./github/workflows/unit_tests.yaml](.github/workflows/unit_tests.yaml) with a matrix over Ubuntu/Windows/macOS and Python 3.12/3.13; after GCP auth we `dvc pull` to get the tracked dataset, then run pytest with coverage. Integration tests in [./github/workflows/integration_tests.yaml](.github/workflows/integration_tests.yaml) do the same to exercise the API end-to-end across OS/Python. For staged models we have a repository_dispatch workflow that pulls a W&B artifact and runs performance tests: [stage_model.yaml](https://github.com/noanorgaard/MLOps_project/actions/workflows/stage_model.yaml). An example of a triggered workflow can be seen [here](https://github.com/noanorgaard/MLOps_project/actions/runs/21066112061).

We cache installs via setup-uv to keep runs quick. The OS/Python matrix finds platform-specific issues early. We block merges unless ruff, mypy, and tests all pass. Pulling data with DVC inside CI means tests and training always use the same versioned dataset, both locally and in the cloud. Secrets stay in GitHub Secrets (GCP key, W&B key), so workflows can authenticate without hard-coding credentials. Coverage reports run on every test workflow, so we see regressions immediately. By keeping lint, unit, integration, and staged-model checks separate, failures are easy to diagnose and rerun. The repository_dispatch hook lets us test a specific staged model on demand without re-running the whole matrix, which keeps performance checks cheap and targeted.

> Answer:

Yes, we implemented energy consumption monitoring using Zeus during model training. Zeus is a framework that tracks GPU energy usage in real-time, providing insights into the environmental and computational cost of training runs. We integrated Zeus into our training pipeline to measure the energy consumed by each training session. This gave us visibility into how much power our experiments used, which is important for understanding the carbon footprint and operational costs of model training, especially when scaling up or running hyperparameter sweeps. By monitoring energy consumption, we could identify more efficient training configurations and make informed decisions about trade-offs between model performance and resource usage.
